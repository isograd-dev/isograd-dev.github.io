# Introduction
The aim of this document is to describe how to use the services the Isograd system offers, either to LTI consumers or via the API.

# Quick start
## LTI
### Connexion

Isograd plateform is compatible with both LTI 1.1 and LTI 1.3 protocols

#### LTI 1.1
Your system should include an area to define LTI providers. In this area, you must:
- Give a name to Isograd LTI Provider
- Specify your client key
- Specify your client secret
Your client key and your client secret will be provided by Isograd upon request.

#### LTI 1.3

**What we require from you**

**What we will provide to you**

![](/assets/img/tool.png)

### Environments
There are two environments, one for testing and the other for production:
- Testing: https://recette.isograd.com/public/lti.php 
- Production : https://app.isograd.com/public/lti.php

### Use a service
Most of the calls made to Isograd LTI Services require **custom parameters** to indicate what you want to achieve. Your system should include the possibility to add custom parameters in your LTI messages.

![](/assets/img/lti_additional_param.jpg)

### Example
To manually test your requests, you can use the LTI Emulation tool accessible here: [https://saltire.lti.app/platform](https://saltire.lti.app/platform). Below is an example of such a test:
![](/assets/img/lti_message.jpg)
![](/assets/img/lti_user.jpg)

## API
### Connexion
The authentication is done via [OAuth](https://oauth.net/getting-started/). To get a token, you need to make a POST request to the following URL:
```
https://auth.isograd.com/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scopes=usage
```
This call must contain two fields: `client_id` and `client_secret`. The content of these fields must be the two values Isograd's team provided you with once your account is created.

### Environments
There are two environments, one for testing and the other for production:
- Testing: https://recette.isograd.com/api/usage
- Production : https://app.isograd.com/api/usage


### Use a service
To use a service, make a POST request to the URL of the chosen environment. The header must contain the field `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`.

### Example
Here is a Python script retrieving an access token, and using the service to [create a candidate](#create-a-candidate)

```python
import requests

# Retrieve the access token
credentials = {
    'client_id': 's0u2c72bman19nm2c45oi1fpea',
    'client_secret': '1mio0273po6si9tvt2f3ld5t6o4hsg02epq71rlfdhlkombkv8ro',
}
auth_url = 'https://auth.isograd.com/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scopes=usage'

r_token = requests.post(auth_url, data=credentials)
access_token = r_token.json()['access_token']

# Use the service
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token}
url_dev = 'https://recette.isograd.com/api/usage'

payload = {
    'act_id': 1,
    'gen_id': 3,
    'ema': 'test@isograd.com',
    'fst_nam': 'John',
    'lst_nam': 'Doe',
}

r_action = requests.post(url_dev, data=payload, headers=headers)
print(r_action.json())

```

The returned JSON object is like so:
```js
{
    'error_message': null,
    'success': true,
    'can_id': 1381134,
    'lgn_url': 'https://recette.isograd.com/continuelogin/CandidateContinueLogin?param=UVR1WjgwRXBwU0'
}
```


# Actions
All your actions must contain a parameter `act_id` that contains the action you want to do: these actions and the parameters that must be sent are described in this section. For every parameter, there will be an indication of whether or not it is required:
- 🟩 Required parameter
- 🔷 **API**: Required parameter **LTI**: parameter already sent via the LTI protocol, do not include it in the additional parameters
- 🟠 Optional parameter 

The answer will be a JSON object, containing a boolean `success`: if `true`, additional properties are sent depending on the action. If `false`, an `error_code` and an `error_message` will be included. Here are the general error messages  (additional codes specific to each actions are provided later in this document)

| error_code  | error_message  |
|---|---|
| 103 | The property act_id is not valid |
| 105 | Property "{name of property}" is requested  |


## Candidate and tests

| ext_dep_id | 🟠 | The id of a group within your system to which the candidate should be added. If no group with this id exists, it will be automatically created |
| psw | 🟠 | The candidate's password. If not provided, the system will generate one randomly |

The response is a JSON object containing the following properties:
- `can_id`: unique integer id of the created candidate on Isograd's platform
- `lgn_url`: a url that can be used by the candidate to login into the platform without entering any credentials

**Errors**

| error_code  | error_message  |
|---|---|
| 201 | The candidate could not be created (probably because one of the parameters is not valid) |
| 202 | There is already a candidate with this email on your account. In such case, the response includes a `can_id` property with the id of the corresponding candidate. |

| redirect | 🟠 | 1: The response will be a HTTP 302 status redirecting to the URL of the test start page |
| ses_id | 🟠 | The session ID to which the test has to be associated |
| add_pro | 🟠 | 1: add remote proctoring to the test. Additional cost will apply.  |

# Appendices
## Language codes
The following values must be used to specify languages:
- 1: French
- 2: English
- 3: German
- 4: Dutch
- 5: Spanish
- 6: Italian
- 7: Greek
- 8: Arabic

## Distributor accounts
Distributor accounts can perform actions on sub accounts that belong to them using the credentials of the distributor account. In such case an additional parameter `sub_com_id` can be added to the request to specify on which sub account the action should be performed.

This integer `sub_com_id` **can be added to all actions described in the section Action.**

## LTI - Grades via Basic Outcome Service
Isograd LTI provider service can return grades through the LTI 1.1 Basic Outcome Service. This allows your system to receive the grade of the candidate automatically at the end of the test. If you wish to receive the grade through Basic Outcome Service, please contact Isograd support to request its activation on your account.

LTI Basic Outcome Service only allows a grade as a decimal number between 0 and 1. The different grade
types are converted into a decimal number between 0 and 1 according to the below rules:
- LEVEL_GRADE_TYPE = 1, the level divided by 10
- SCORE_GRADE_TYPE = 2, the score divided by 1000
- AVERAGE_GRADE_TYPE = 3, the score divided by 1000
- NUM_CORRECT_GRADE_TYPE = 4, the percentage of correct answers that is: number of correct
answers / number of questions
- RANGE_GRADE_TYPE = 5, the middle value of the relevant range divided by 1000
- ON_100_AVERAGE_GRADE_TYPE = 15, the score divided by 1000
